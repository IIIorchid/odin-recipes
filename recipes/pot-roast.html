    <p>When it comes to a Sunday dinner in America, there’s nothing quite as classic as pot roast. Of course, the day of the week doesn’t really matter, pot roast is a delicious dinner for any day of the week. A good pot roast can be made with any cut of beef roast. Popular choices include chuck roast, round roast, and briskets. The beef is seasoned and seared. The pan then needs to be deglazed with a braising liquid—commonly beef broth and red wine. We like to add in garlic and Worcestershire sauce for a more complex flavor. It really kicks things up a notch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1, 3 to 5 pound beef roast chuck, round, or brisket</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cups red wine</li>
        <li>2 cups low sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 large white onions cut into 2 inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 pound baby carrots</li>
        <li>1 pound red potatoes cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Get a large oven safe dutch oven pot heating over high heat.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of chuck roast with salt and pepper. Add vegetable oil to pot and sear roast until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes each side.</li>
        <li>Remove roast from pan and set aside briefly on a plate or cutting board. Add garlic to pot and saute 60 seconds. Deglaze  pan with red wine and beef broth. Add roast back to the pot.</li>
        <li>Pour Worcetershire sauce over roast and place the onion chunks, carrots, and potatoes on top of and around the meat. Place rosemary sprig on top.</li>
        <li>Place a lid on the pan and transfer it to the preheated 350 degree oven. Cook 3 hours, or until meat reaches an internal temperature of 202 degrees F and shreds easily with a fork. Season vegetables with additional salt and pepper to taste and serve hot.</li>
